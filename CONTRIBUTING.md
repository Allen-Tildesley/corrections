# Reporting errors

First, thanks for your interest in our book "Computer Simulation of Liquids".

The "Issues" system on this GitHub repository is intended for reporting errors in the text of the book.
We welcome any such reports, and will endeavour to add them to the [list of errata](errata.pdf) here as quickly as possible.

Please feel free to open an issue if you see a typographical error, an error in an equation, or any other mistake in the text,
assuming that you have already checked the current [list of errata](errata.pdf) and any current open issues, to avoid duplication.
Do specify exactly the page, and the line or equation number, containing the error.

Please _do not_ raise as an issue any general questions about molecular simulation methods. Discussions of this kind are outside the scope of this site.

Finally, please note that the example codes associated with the book are provided in a different repository: <https://github.com/Allen-Tildesley/examples>. If you spot a bug or error in one of the codes, or the supplied documentation, please report it there!

# Corrections
Corrections to the text of the book "Computer Simulation of Liquids" by Michael P. Allen and Dominic J. Tildesley (2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 2017)

## Errata
The authors intend to maintain a list of errata and other corrections here.
Please feel free to notify us of any mistakes,
ideally via the [Issues page](https://github.com/Allen-Tildesley/corrections/issues)

## Caveat
This repository is solely intended for correction of errors in the text.
We do not intend to get into discussions of
molecular simulation techniques and their relative merits,
whether mentioned in the book or not,
or to give advice on simulations.
